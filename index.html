            <h2>Our Investment Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Our quant fund aims to achieve capital appreciation and maximize absolute returns through a fully automated, quantitative trading system that utilizes proprietary algorithms. By capitalizing on opportunities in derivatives markets—specifically options and futures—we profit from price movements and market inefficiencies. We maintain base positions that track market indices and strategically use derivatives to hedge or amplify these positions. Emphasizing disciplined risk management, we actively monitor position risk levels during trading hours, employ multiple layers of risk prevention mechanisms—including force liquidation triggers—and conservatively select new positions to minimize the risk-to-reward ratio. Operating with minimal manual intervention, our system ensures consistent and timely responses to market conditions.</p>
